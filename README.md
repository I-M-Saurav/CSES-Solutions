# 🧠 CSES Problem Set Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).

---

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized by topic as they appear on the CSES site. Each folder corresponds to one category.  
Example:

CSES-Solutions/
├── Introductory_Problems/
│ ├── weird_algorithm.cpp
│ ├── missing_number.cpp
│ └── ...
├── Sorting_and_Searching/
│ └── ...
├── Dynamic_Programming/
│ └── ...
├── Graph_Algorithms/
│ └── ...
├── ...
└── README.md


> ✏️ Filenames follow `snake_case`, and solutions are currently written in **C++**.
